# Cryptocurrency Analysis

## Background

The purpose of this project was to analyze a variety of alternative cryptocurrencies available on the market for viable investments. This is to help fill the gap in cryptos now that bitcoin is prohibitively expensive for many individuals/firms to directly invest into now. Other common ones such as Etherum are also becoming more and more expensive quickly, therefore making them harder to invest into with lower starting capital. Therefore this analysis hopes to use unsupervised machine learning to see if we can find any trends that result in bigger opportuninties in these alternative cryptocurrencies.

## Summary
The unsupervised machine learning algorithms were able to find 4 distinct patterns/groups, labeled as classes, within the dataset that was provided ot it. That being said one of the classes was clearly an outlier within the data and would most likely be ignored when deeper analysis is completed on this data set. We would also need to further analyze each individual class to ascertain how viable each cryptocurrency within each class was for investment in the future. However the clusters found by the algorithm allow for others to get a better understanding of the general possible profitability of these cryptocurrencies without needing to rely on a human to do the initial research.
